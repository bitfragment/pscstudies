Session meeting format is roundtable-style discussion.

I will lead us through the reading, and I have no specific expectations about your verbal participation, though it's most welcome.

If you have a special interest in a particular book or article and would find it productive to lead us through some portion of it yourself, that's also most welcome, though it's not required.

During the final thirty minutes or so of our meeting period, you'll each take a turn describing some item of related material that you've uncovered that week on your own. This might be anything from another book (scholarly, literary, or otherwise) to an article, conference paper, blog post, film, recording, or most anything else.

See [Requirements]({{ site.baseurl }}/05-requirements/) for more details.
