Required readings appear in the [schedule]({{site.baseurl}}/index). Of course, we can't read everything relevant in one semester. The selection represents an attempt to balance what *you* need to know in order to get up to speed in the three domains in question with what *I* will find it productive to read along with you. (Some other work I know too well already and don't care to reread.) In general, exclusions from our selection (or from the supplementary lists below) are made practically, rather than as a judgment on relevance.
